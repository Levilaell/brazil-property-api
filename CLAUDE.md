# Brazil Property API - Claude Context

## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive TDD-driven Brazilian real estate API that scrapes property data from major real estate websites (ZAP, VivaReal) and provides market analysis, price history, and neighborhood statistics.

## Development Approach
- **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**: Red → Green → Refactor
- **Coverage Target**: 90%+ code coverage
- **Testing Framework**: pytest with VS Code integration
- **Virtual Environment**: Python venv for isolation

## Key Technologies
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Cache**: Redis with memory fallback
- **Scraping**: BeautifulSoup, requests
- **Testing**: pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-mock
- **Security**: Rate limiting, API keys
- **Monitoring**: Custom analytics system

## Core Features
1. **Property Search**: Search properties by city, price range, size, etc.
2. **Price History**: Historical price data and trends
3. **Market Analysis**: Investment opportunities and market insights
4. **Neighborhood Stats**: Area statistics and ratings
5. **Cache System**: Multi-layer caching for performance
6. **Rate Limiting**: API protection and usage control
7. **Analytics**: Request tracking and performance metrics

## Development Commands
```bash
# Setup virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run tests
pytest                           # All tests
pytest -m unit                  # Unit tests only
pytest -m integration           # Integration tests
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html  # With coverage

# Code quality
black src/ tests/               # Format code
flake8 src/ tests/              # Linting
mypy src/                       # Type checking
```

## Testing Guidelines
- Write tests BEFORE implementation (TDD)
- Mock external dependencies
- Use pytest fixtures for test data
- Maintain 90%+ code coverage
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Use descriptive test names

## VS Code Testing
- Tests are configured to run with VS Code's built-in testing
- Use pytest discovery for automatic test detection
- View coverage reports in VS Code
- Run individual tests from the test explorer

## Security Considerations
- Never commit API keys or secrets
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper input validation
- Rate limit all endpoints
- Log security events

## Performance Targets
- API response time < 500ms
- Cache hit ratio > 85%
- 99.9% uptime target
- Error rate < 1%

## Notes for Claude
- Always write tests before implementation
- Use the TodoWrite tool to track progress
- Maintain high code coverage
- Follow Python best practices
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Keep functions small and focused
- Document complex business logic
- Test error handling thoroughly
